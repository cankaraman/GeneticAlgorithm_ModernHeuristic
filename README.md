Implement a genetic algorithm for the 0-1 knapsack problem. Use the problems P06, P07, P08 on  https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/datasets/knapsack_01/knapsack_01.html for testing your algorithm. Implement repair, death penalty and penalty methods for constraint handling. Run your GA for 10 times for each of the methods on three problems and report the best, average and worst fitness value for each method..
